# Pro-UGATIT
## Progressively Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation

Pro-UGATIT is a state-of-the-art framework aimed at providing advanced image-to-image translation functionality. It builds upon the original UGATIT implementation by [shoutOutYangJie](https://github.com/shoutOutYangJie/Morph-UGATIT), and aims to expand and refine the concept for various image translation tasks.

### Overview
The implementation encompasses various progressive techniques to achieve high-quality image translation through unsupervised learning. Adaptive Layer Instance Normalization (AdaLIN) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of the model.

### Features
- **Progressive Learning:** Utilizes a staged learning approach to increase translation accuracy.
- **Unsupervised Approach:** Capable of translating images without the need for labeled data.
- **Adaptive Layer Normalization:** Enhances model flexibility and adaptability.

### Installation
You can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sam3u7858/pro-ugatit.git
cd Pro-UGATIT
pip install -r requirements.txt
