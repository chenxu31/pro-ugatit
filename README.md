Pro-UGATIT is an image-to-image translation implementation based on the UGATIT model developed by shoutOutYangJie in their Morph-UGATIT project. Our version of UGATIT incorporates the concept of progressively unsupervised generative attentional networks with adaptive layer instance normalization to achieve high-quality image translation results.

## Introduction

Image-to-image translation is a challenging task where the goal is to transform an input image from one domain to another while preserving relevant details. Pro-UGATIT enhances the UGATIT model with adaptive layer instance normalization, enabling it to produce more visually appealing and realistic translations between diverse image domains.

## Installation

To use Pro-UGATIT, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pro-UGATIT.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained weights for the model from [link-to-pretrained-weights](https://link-to-pretrained-weights.com) and place them in the `weights/` directory.

## Usage

Once you have installed Pro-UGATIT and obtained the pre-trained weights, you can start translating images as follows:

```bash
python translate.py --input input_image.jpg --output output_image.jpg --weights weights_path
```

Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to your input image and `output_image.jpg` with the desired output file name. Make sure to specify the correct path for `weights_path`.
