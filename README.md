# Pro-UGATIT
[Pro-UGATIT](https://github.com/sam3u7858/pro-ugatit) is a framework for Progressively Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer Instance Normalization (UGATIT) designed specifically for Image-to-Image Translation.

This implementation builds upon the pioneering work of [shoutOutYangJie's UGATIT implementation](https://github.com/shoutOutYangJie/Morph-UGATIT). We have extended the existing model to incorporate new concepts and techniques, enhancing the image-to-image translation process.

## Objective
We aim to introduce novel concepts and enhancements for image-to-image translation, offering a robust and flexible framework that can adapt to various tasks and domains.

## Features
- Progressive Training
- Adaptive Layer Instance Normalization
- Improved Efficiency and Performance

## Installation
Instructions for setting up and running Pro-UGATIT can be found in the [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) file.

## Usage
A detailed guide on how to use Pro-UGATIT, including examples, is provided in the [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) file.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to the Pro-UGATIT project! Whether you want to report a bug, propose a feature, or contribute code, please refer to the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
